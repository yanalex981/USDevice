## USDevice (Ultrasonic Device)

Engineering Design (ES 1050) Project 3

## About

The 3rd design project entailed the creation of a product that is of benefit to disadvantaged groups of people, such as medical, regional, financial problems, etc.

Our group decided to assist the visually impaired by creating a cheap device that gauges distance using ultrasound, and informs the user with auditory feedback by beeping more frequently as the user approaches an obstacle, and less frequently when the distance lengthens.

This heart of this device is an Arduino compatible microcontroller, and has been tested to work with an Arduino Uno R3, and a Teensy 3.2
